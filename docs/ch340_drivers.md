If you've never connected a USB-to-serial converter to your computer before, you may need to install drivers. The drivers will depend on your USB-to-serial converter. In this case, the SparkFun RTK Torch is populated with the CH34X and a RedBoard IoT Development Board (ESP32) used to connect to a UM980 is populated with the CH340.

You may need to install drivers for the USB-to-serial converter. Check out our section on "[How to Install CH340 Drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-serial-basic-ch340c-hookup-guide#drivers-if-you-need-them)" for help with the installation.
